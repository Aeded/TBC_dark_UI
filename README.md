# TBC_dark_UI
Recolored client textures and icons

If you are already colloring some parts of UI through addon, 
you might want to disable it otherwise it is going to look very dark. 
(For those using SchakaPvPUI: Just change every SetVertexColor(x, y, z) to SetVertexColor(1, 1, 1) that will remove the extra darkening.


Did not test on any resolution above 1980x1080. Also changing Video settings bugs out the UI textures (relog will fix them).

Pro tip: Save your current UI before trying this one.

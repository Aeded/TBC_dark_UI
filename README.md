# TBC_dark_UI
Recolored client textures and icons

Extract the folder into \World of Warcraft\Interface
If you put it in AddOns folder it will not work. If you are already colloring some
parts of UI through addon, you might want to disable it or it is going to look very dark.


Todo:
1. Upload second version of only recolored blizz textures (some UI elements are atm slightly edited for my needs)
2. Upload unified icon style (some icons are rounded and some have sharp edges. Im able to make everything sharp edged, but dont know way how to make everything rounded)
3. Add more customized textures (transparent glow, make black borders around portraits in better way)

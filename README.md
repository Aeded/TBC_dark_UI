**FAQ:**

**Q: What is this? An Addon?**

A: No, it is not an Addon, it is recolored UI texture files.
   
**Q: How do I install this?**

A: Open the .zip file and extract all the folders into World of Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface
   DO NOT PUT THE FOLDERS INTO Warcraft\_classic_beta_\Interface\AddOns
   
**Q: How do I change the color? Could you do X for me please?**

A: You cant. No I could not.

**Q: On some addons certain UI elemets like sliders appear bigger? And some textures appear in default grey state?**

A: Im a busy man, but eventualy I will fix it.

If you are already colloring some parts of UI through addon, 
you might want to disable it otherwise it is going to look very dark. 
(For those using SchakaPvPUI: Just change every SetVertexColor(x, y, z) to SetVertexColor(1, 1, 1) that will remove the extra darkening.


Did not test on any resolution above 1980x1080. Also changing Video settings bugs out the UI textures (relog will fix them).

# Pro tip: Save your current UI before trying this one.
